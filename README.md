 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GETTING STARTED: 
 In the process of hosting on an AWS server currently please host locally.
 For testing and development purposes running in a local server is preferred for now.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 HOW TO HOST LOCALLY:
 There are many ways to host the website locally, for this setup, we will use XAMMP and APACHE 
 to create a local server to host the website. First ensure you have XAMPP downloaded and 
 this can be accomplished by downloading the necessary download at https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
 where you can select a download for Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems.
 After downloading run the installer and download the required packages and any extra packages you wish.
 Once this is done you can then run the XAMPP controller and start your APACHE web server once this is running 
 you are ready to run the website locally. Navigate to where you are storing the downloaded files from this 
 repository or if you have not downloaded them do so. The needed files for this step are SQLConnect.php, TechScript.js, 
 TechTrove.php, and styles.css 
 Now take these files either copying them or moving them to the file htdocs which is located in the xampp folder. 
 Then open up your preferred web browser and go to localhost which should take you to the XAMPP home page if the server is 
 running properly. 
 
 You can now go to localhost/TechTrove.php  which will take you to the website and can then be utilized.
